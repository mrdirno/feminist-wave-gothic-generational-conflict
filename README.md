## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a letter from Cat's mother to Evangeline that was never sent, explaining her flight to California and her choice of a 'quiet life'.
- Draft a lost chapter from Evangeline's seminal work, 'The Gorgon's Gaze', that was too personal or too brutal to publish.
- Create a scene where Mrs. O'Brien confronts Evangeline about the emotional cost of her 'ruthless clarity', set in the kitchen years before Cat's arrival.
- Write a monologue from the perspective of Black Rock House itself, feeling the weight of the Black women's lives and conflicts within its walls.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Black Rock House where users can click on rooms (study, kitchen, east bedroom) to uncover fragments of manuscript, audio of the sea, or character memories.
- Create a 'Generational Echo' text tool that allows a user to input a modern sentence and see it transformed through the linguistic and ideological filters of Evangeline (1970s radical feminist), her daughter (1980s pragmatic exile), and Cat (contemporary seeker).
